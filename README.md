This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

Dear Dr.Xiaojuan MaI came to know you from your website and the works in your HCI group attract me.

 I'm a research assistant in Computer School of Fudan University under the supervision of Prof. Mingmin Chi. I'm currently spending my leap year working on face recognition. I obtained B.Eng. degree at Wuhan University (China) in 2018. I was an intern in Big Data Mining Group in Microsoft Research Asia, supervised by Dr. Borje Karlsson, working on language understanding service. 
 
 I would like to pursue research in HCI, Human-AI collaboration and explainable AI. I'm attracted by infinite potential in human-computer interaction, for which I learnt visualization and front-end tech, and make full use of them on my daily work. I used visualization while working on MSRA to demonstracte benchmark result and explain the black-box model, and built labeling-tool for active learning. I believe that interpretability of AI will serve an important role in future and I'm thrilled to build AI-based HCI applications.

I hope you don’t mind my getting in touch, but I’d like to inquire whether you are currently accepting PhD/Mphil students. If you are, would you willing to talk to me a bit more by email. I have explored your website in detail, and it seems like an excellent fit for me.

I would be grateful if you could please consider my application. 

Here is my website: https://remch183.github.io

Thanking you.

Best,
Zixuan Chen
